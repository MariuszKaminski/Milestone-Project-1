## Introduction and Purpose

This project has been created as Milestone One project for my Diploma Level 5 in Web Development, a course run by Harlow College in association with Code Institute. 
In this document you will find the documentation, which accompanies the website that I have designed and developed for GYM4U, a fictional gym facility that I have based on real life gym facilities operating in my local area.

## Problem Statement

The customer - “GymForU”, a local independent gym, wants to enhance their online presence by means of a custom build website. The page should provide prospective members with information on the offered range of services and provide an online hub for the existing community of members. The customer wants their website up and running within a period of one month. For this purpose they have allocated a budged of £2000.

## Analysis

### Feasibility study:
1.	The custom built website would certainly be beneficial, as other ways of advertising may prove to be more expensive and not as efficient in the long run as a permanent interactive and responsive website would.
2.	In the face of growing competition from gym chains and other locally run gyms and providing that the customer has at their disposal the funds needed, there is no reason to delay the development and deployment of the website.
3.	The website will bring awareness of the facility and what they can offer helping to attract undecided prospective members from the local area and even further away.
 
### Functional Requirements
1.	It must present introductory information about gym features that set it apart from other gyms in the area. It should include the full range of offered services.
2.	It has to present a detailed weekly class schedule.
3.	It has to provide information about the location, contact details and opening times.
4.	It needs to have a “members area” where classes and other services could be booked as well as feedback provided.
5.	It needs to have a “sign up” section where new members could express their interest in joining in as a member and book a taster session or induction.
6.	The website should include a gallery which presents the facilities and the range of equipment available and the friendly social atmosphere during classes.
7.	The website should point to all other social media sites that belong to the gym.
8.	Responsive design utilising HTML5/CSS3 scripts.

### Non-functional Requirements
1.	Website completion deadline: 2nd of July, 2021
2.	The website should comprise of no more than 3 web pages.
3.	Author’s skillset.
4.	Website should promote the brand i.e. the company logo and the company colours (teal, black, grey and white)
5.	Be aesthetically pleasing and provide good user experience.

### User needs:
1.	The website should help the user to make a decision whether Gym4U is the right kind of gym facility for them
2.	They should be able to obtain all basic information about membership types, pricing, available classes, equipment, facilities and location
3.	They want the website to be easy to be accessible and easy to navigate
