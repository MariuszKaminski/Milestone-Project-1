## Introduction and Purpose

This project has been created as Milestone One project for my Diploma Level 5 in Web Development, a course run by Harlow College in association with Code Institute. 
In this document you will find the documentation, which accompanies the website that I have designed and developed for GYM4U, a fictional gym facility that I have based on real life gym facilities operating in my local area.

## Problem Statement

The customer - “GymForU”, a local independent gym, wants to enhance their online presence by means of a custom build website. The page should provide prospective members with information on the offered range of services and provide an online hub for the existing community of members. The customer wants their website up and running within a period of one month. For this purpose they have allocated a budget of £2000.

## Analysis

### Feasibility study:
1.	The custom built website would certainly be beneficial, as other ways of advertising may prove to be more expensive and not as efficient in the long run as a permanent interactive and responsive website would.
2.	In the face of growing competition from gym chains and other locally run gyms and providing that the customer has at their disposal the funds needed, there is no reason to delay the development and deployment of the website.
3.	The website will bring awareness of the facility and what they can offer helping to attract undecided prospective members from the local area and even further away.
 
### Functional Requirements
1.	It must present introductory information about gym features that set it apart from other gyms in the area. It should include the full range of offered services.
2.	It has to present a detailed weekly class schedule.
3.	It has to provide information about the location, contact details and opening times.
4.	It needs to have a “members area” where classes and other services could be booked as well as feedback provided.
5.	It needs to have a “sign up” section where new members could express their interest in joining in as a member and book a taster session or induction.
6.	The website should include a gallery which presents the facilities and the range of equipment available and the friendly social atmosphere during classes.
7.	The website should point to all other social media sites that belong to the gym.
8.	Responsive design utilising HTML5/CSS3 scripts.

### Non-functional Requirements
1.	Website completion deadline: 2nd of July, 2021
2.	The website should comprise of no more than 3 web pages.
3.	Author’s skillset.
4.	Website should promote the brand i.e. the company logo and the company colours (teal, black, grey and white)
5.	Be aesthetically pleasing and provide good user experience.

### User needs:
1.	The website should help the user to make a decision whether Gym4U is the right kind of gym facility for them
2.	They should be able to obtain all basic information about membership types, pricing, available classes, equipment, facilities and location
3.	They want the website to be easy to be accessible and easy to navigate

## Design Considerations

### Colours
The colours used for the design are in line with Gym4U brand colours which include the following:
* teal (#008080) 
* grey (#4a4a4f) 
* black (#000000)  
* white  (#FFFFFF)

### Fonts
For the text content the website utilizes Goole Font “Noto Sans”. Font size has been consistently maintained as 1.6em for h2 headings, 1.4em for important information and regular font for smaller print.

### Design ideas:
I have reused and adapted the idea of the semi-transparent cards on a photo background that can be found in Code Institute’s “Love Running” tutorial. This design has been applied to “Classes” and “Contact Us” homepage sections. Also the layout of the photographs in the Gallery page follows the example of masonry design principle from the same tutorial.

## Features
Large-sized logo is prominently displayed at the homepage page with small-sized logo always visible on the navbar.
All homepage section headings and cards in the “Contact Us” section are accompanied with Fontawesome icons. 

### Navbar
![Navbar desktop version](./assets/img/navbar.PNG)

The navbar is displayed on all website pages and containing a small gym logo. It  provides links to “About”, “Classes” and “Contact “ homepage sections as well as to “Gallery” and  “Sign in/Sign up” pages within the website.

### Logo

### Classes Section
![Classes section desktop version](./assets/img/classes_section.PNG)
The classes section contains weekly class schedule with each day of the week on a separate semi-transparent card on a photo background.

### Contact Us Section
![Contact us section desktop version](./assets/img/contact_us_section.PNG)
This section contains four subsections providing: address, contact details, opening time and iframe with google map showing the gym’s exact location. The subsections are in the form of semi-transparent cards with the town’s photo as a background.

### Footer
![Footer desktop version](./assets/img/footer.PNG)
The footer, displayed on all pages, provides a basic copyright information and links to the gym’s social media sites in the form of Fontawesome icons.

### Gallery
![Gallery desktop version](./assets/img/gallery.PNG)
The gallery comprises photos of different sizes grouped in 4 columns. The photos give a preview of gym’s facilities, equipment and available activities. The gallery follows the ‘masonry’ design principle.

### Members Sign in Form
![Sign in form desktop version](./assets/img/members_area.PNG)

The form lists all extra benefits the members are entitled. It enables the members to log in by entering their log in details and pressing the “sign in” button.

### New Members Sing up Form
![Sign up form desktop version](./assets/img/new_members_sign_in.PNG)

The purpose of the sign up form is to aid the customers who have made a decision to join the gym to book an introductory session and create their member’s account at the website. For this reason some basic personal details need to be gathered from the form’s input fields.

### Membership/Admission Pricing Table
![Pricing table desktop version](./assets/img/membership_pricing.PNG)

The purpose of the table is to present prospective customers with the whole range of flexible payment options for the gym’s services.
